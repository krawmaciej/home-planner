 - linked list as walls representation, connections containing components
 - conversion from 2d to 3d, why can't walls overlap: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering
 - solution with not overlapping walls lets easily select for which wall does the wall component belong to, and it also solves z-fighting problem.

Algorithms(solutions to problems) to describe:
 - creating a wall with a hole for window/door
 - save/caching state
 - updating state from two places (renderer + UI)
 - selecting object from the renderer (update scene)
 - distinction between object that can be selected depending on selected menu
 - keeping object inside wall/on the room scene (???? might be not needed)

done (checked):
See if walls "sticked" together let light go through,
does the ceiling and floor make any light artifacts if they are solid blocks
above and below the walls

LATER (never):
 - dissappearing of wall and ceiling when looking from given angle (vector dot product algorithms)
 - optimization of rendering (also hookup listeners from menu to renderer):
https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-rendering-on-demand.html


done:
 - move drawing to render instead of spamming every mouse movement
 - fix collision so it gets all the intersection points, and splits the drawn wall properly
 - handle: lines starting and ending on the same point
